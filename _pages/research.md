My research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. My ongoing research interests are as follows.

* Decentralized computing

* Statistical data fusion

* Statistical machine learning

* Subsampling methods in big data

* Large-scale optimal transport problems
